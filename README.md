A WebRTC meeting service using [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org).

![demo](demo.gif)

Try it online at https://letsmeet.no. You can add /roomname to the URL for specifying a room.

## Features

* Audio/Video
* Chat
* Screen sharing
* File sharing
* Different layouts
* Internationalization support
* Local Recording

## Local Recording

* Local Recording records the browser window video and audio. From the list of media formats that your  browser supports you can select your preferred media format in the settings menu advanced video menu setting.  MediaRecorder makes small chucks of recording and these recorded blob chunks temporary stored in IndexedDB, if IndexedDB implemented in your browser. Otherwise it stores blobs in memory in an array of blobs.
Local Recording creates a local IndexedDB with the name of the starting timestamp (unix timestamp format)  And a storage called chunks. All chunks read in an array and created a final blob that you can download. After blobs array concatenation as a big blob, this big blob saved as file, and finally we delete the temporary local IndexedDB.

* **WARNINIG**: Take care that You need for local recording extra cpu, memory and disk space.
  **You need to have good enough free disk space!!**
Keep in mind that Browsers don't allow to use all the disk free capacity!
See more info about browsers storage limits:
  * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria#storage_limits>
  * <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/master/storage/browser/quota/quota_settings.cc#68>

* If there is an error during recording, or browser crashed or you accidentally close your tab, you can recover and save to file your data stored in the IndexDB with the following way. Open browser console and run function CLIENT.recoverRecording(`DB_NAME`) Where `DB_NAME` is the name of Indexed DataBase, so the starting date in unix timestamp format of the recording. If you open your browser developer console and find IndexDB storage info, you can find the name of your IndexedDB recording. It is a unix timestamp, the timestamp of the start of your recording.

## Package Installation

If you want to install it on the Debian & Ubuntu based operating systems.

* Prerequisites:
edumeet will run on nodejs v10.x and later versions. (v12.x has a know issue for now, please until it will be fixed use the 10.x version)
To install see here [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall).

* Download .deb package from [here](https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet/actions?query=workflow%3ADeployer+branch%3Amaster+is%3Asuccess) (job artifact)

* Unzip the file

```bash
$ unzip edumeet.zip
```

* Install the package

```bash
$ sudo apt install edumeet/edumeet.deb
```

* After package installation, don't forget the configure ip address in config file.

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/meeting/server-config.js
```

* Finally, start the service by (it's enabled by default)

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start edumeet
```

## Manual installation

* Prerequisites:
Currently edumeet will only run on nodejs v13.x
To install see here [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall).

```bash
$ sudo apt install git npm build-essential redis
```

* Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet.git
$ cd edumeet
```

* Copy `server/config/config.example.js` to `server/config/config.js` :

```bash
$ cp server/config/config.example.js server/config/config.js
```

* Copy `app/public/config/config.example.js` to `app/public/config/config.js` :

```bash
$ cp app/public/config/config.example.js app/public/config/config.js
```

* Edit your two `config.js` with appropriate settings (listening IP/port, logging options, **valid** TLS certificate, don't forget ip setting in last section in server config: (webRtcTransport), etc).

* Set up the browser app:

```bash
$ cd app
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This will build the client application and copy everythink to `server/public` from where the server can host client code to browser requests.

* Set up the server:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ cd server
$ npm install
```

## Run it locally

* Run the Node.js server application in a terminal:

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm start
```

* Note: Do not run the server as root. If you need to use port 80/443 make a iptables-mapping for that or use systemd configuration for that (see further down this doc).
* Test your service in a webRTC enabled browser: `https://yourDomainOrIPAdress:3443/roomname`

## Deploy it in a server

* Stop your locally running server. Copy systemd-service file `edumeet.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/` and check location path settings:

```bash
$ cp edumeet.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ edit /etc/systemd/system/edumeet.service
```

* Reload systemd configuration and start service:

```bash
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start edumeet
```

* If you want to start edumeet at boot time:

```bash
$ systemctl enable edumeet
```

## Ports and firewall

* 3443/tcp (default https webserver and signaling - adjustable in `server/config.js`)
* 4443/tcp (default `npm start` port for developing with live browser reload, not needed in production environments - adjustable in app/package.json)
* 40000-49999/udp/tcp (media ports - adjustable in `server/config.js`)

## Load balanced installation

To deploy this as a load balanced cluster, have a look at [HAproxy](HAproxy.md).

## Learning management integration

To integrate with an LMS (e.g. Moodle), have a look at [LTI](LTI/LTI.md).

## TURN configuration

* You need an additional [TURN](https://github.com/coturn/coturn)-server for clients located behind restrictive firewalls! Add your server and credentials to `server/config/config.js`

## Community-driven support

* Open mailing list: community@lists.edumeet.org
* Subscribe: lists.edumeet.org/sympa/subscribe/community/
* Open archive: lists.edumeet.org/sympa/arc/community/
